							<h1>The Power is in Your Hands</h1>
							<p>
								Scleroderma is a rare disease. Often, persons with scleroderma do not know other people with the disease and may live in a state where there is no chapter of the Scleroderma Foundation or in a community where there are no support groups available. As part of a research study, this web based self-management program was designed is to help you learn about scleroderma, manage your symptoms and learn strategies to help you advocate for yourself. Knowledge and advocacy skills need to be continually woven, like a basket, into ones daily life. Managing a chronic disease involves lifelong learning and one’s “basket” should NEVER be complete.
