							<p>Systemic Sclerosis (systemic scleroderma) is a rare disease. Often, persons with scleroderma do not know other people with the disease. They may live in a state where there is no chapter of the Scleroderma Foundation or Scleroderma Research Foundation or in a community where there are no support groups available. The purpose of this internet-based self-management program is to give you the skills and confidence to manage your symptoms and impact of scleroderma, and to teach you strategies to help you advocate for yourself.  Knowledge and advocacy skills need to be continuously woven, like a basket, into ones daily life.  Managing a chronic disease involves lifelong learning and one’s “basket” should NEVER be complete.</p>
							<p>Scleroderma is very complex and affects every person differently; each person is unique. Some of the modules on the website may not apply to you, but the information is provided so you will have it if you need it. There are also links to other websites if you want more information on a topic, because the purpose of this website is to give you skills to manage the disease.</p>
							<p>The website has an audio voice-over so you can listen to the narration; be sure your audio is on. However, if you do not want to hear the audio you can mute the sound on your computer and just read the text, which is right at the bottom of the computer screen.  As a participant  in the research study, we ask you to please read each of the modules, complete the learning activities, and look at the Resources that go with each module.  We also ask that you open the Discussion board as questions are posted, and read the responses.  You do not have to respond to comments and questions, but hopefully you will feel comfortable and share your tips in managing scleroderma. <strong>Please do not share the contents of this website with anyone but your immediate family as the information is private and confidential.</strong></p>
